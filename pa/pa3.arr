#| A binary /search/ tree (BST), in contrast to a regular old binary
   tree, is one in which:

   (i) The nodes -- not the leaves -- contain the data, and

   (ii) The data items are ordered such that for any node, the data
   items in the node's left child are less than the data item in the
   node and the data items in the node's right child are greater than
   the data item in the node.

   If you've forgotten how binary search trees work, you can refresh
   your memory here:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree.

   We'll be using BSTs of Numbers with the usual ordering on Numbers
   (as provided by Pyret's '<' operator).
|#

data BSTree:
  | bst-leaf
  | bst-node(val :: Number, left :: BSTree, right :: BSTree)
end

#| The binary search tree invariant can be encoded as a function in
   Pyret as follows: |#

fun bst-all(f :: (Number -> Boolean), t :: BSTree) -> Boolean:
  cases (BSTree) t:
    | bst-leaf => true
    | bst-node(n, l, r) => f(n) and bst-all(f, l) and bst-all(f, r)
  end
end

fun bst-inv(b :: BSTree) -> Boolean:
  cases(BSTree) b:
    | bst-leaf => true
    | bst-node(m, l, r) =>
      bst-inv(l) and
      bst-inv(r) and
      bst-all(lam(n): n < m end, l) and
      bst-all(lam(n): n > m end, r)
  end

#| 1. (3 pts) Define a function 'bst-lookup' that determines whether a

   into a binary search tree such that the following property holds:

   if bst-inv(b) is true initially, then bst-inv(bst-insert(b, n)) is
   true after the insertion. I.e., bst-insert should preserve the BST
   invariant (note that this property is encoded into the type of
   the function by the use of BST instead of BSTree).

   NOTE: If the number is already in the tree, then your
   bst-insert function should leave the tree unchanged. |#

#| The following data structure, RBTree, defines red-black binary
   trees (essentially just BTrees augmented with color information --
   red or black). If you haven't seen such trees before, or
   just forget, you can refresh your memory by reading the article
   here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree. |#

data Color:
  | red
  | black
end

data RBTree<T>:
  | rbt-leaf(c :: Color)
  | rbt-node(c :: Color, val :: T, left :: RBTree<T>, right :: RBTree<T>)
end

#| 3. (10 pts) In order for an RBTree to be a valid red-black tree,
   all of the following properties must hold:

   (o) All nodes are either red or black.

   (i) The root node is black.

   (ii) All leaves are black.

   (iii) If a node is red, then both its children are black.

   (iv) Any path from any node in the tree to any of its descendent
   black leaf nodes has the same number of black nodes (not including
   the node itself but including the leaf node) as any other such path
   from that node.

   (v) The tree additionally satisfies the binary search tree
   invariant as explained in WARMUP exercise 3 above.

   These properties together imply that the height of an RBTree is
   pretty much balanced -- no left subtree of a node can be more than
   2x deeper than the right subtree of that node, and vice versa.

   Define a function 'rbt-inv' that determines whether a given RBTree
   satisfies the RBT invariant as described above.

   HINT 1: You probably don't need to directly encode property (o) --
   it's automatically true of every RBTree by construction.

   HINT 2: You may find it helpful to define one function for each
   property (i--iv) above. Then your overall rbt-inv function can just
   string these individual invariant-checking functions together. |#
